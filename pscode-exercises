// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

start 
enter number
check if number is even or odd ( n /2 =0)
if even number print "even number"
if an odd number print "odd number"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a messageIf  describing what they are

Start by getting inputs for the 5 values.
Next, the average of the 5 values is calculated.
The fourth line iterates through the numbers.
Calculate the smallest and the largest values with conditional statements. 
print the average, the smallest and the largest input.
